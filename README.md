Spotify Album Radio app

I enjoy listening to entire albums as artists often have an overarching theme to their 
album and my favorite songs don't tend to be those that are the released tracks.  I've always had to append 
albums to playlists manually, using related artist recommendations from Spotify or Last.fm.  The app has two 
primary functions, adding whole albums to the end of a playlist and deleting played songs from the beginning.  The rest is gravy :)

Other notes
-----------

My first Git project and first public project, so take it easy on me :)

I'm using VS2012 as my editor because I'm used to the keyboard shortcuts and editor quirks.
